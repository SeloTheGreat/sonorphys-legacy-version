# Legacy SONORphys

A roblox [Physics Character Controller](https://create.roblox.com/docs/physics/character-controllers) wrapper.

The package should be placed in `ReplicatedStorage`, no further setup is necessary, other than configuration

I'd write some important stuff here but this library kind of sucks, a new version is going to be worked on...
